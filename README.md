Step 1: Setting up the Development Environment with Docker

Install Docker on your system if you haven't already done so.
Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in the terminal.
Create a new Docker Compose file with the following services:
A Python service with the latest version of Python installed.
A MySQL or PostgreSQL service for the database.
A web server service (such as NGINX or Apache) to serve the web application.
Set the environment variables for the database connection (such as the database name, username, and password).
Build and run the Docker containers with the docker-compose up command.
Step 2: Creating Database Models with Python ORM

Choose a Python ORM (such as SQLAlchemy or Django ORM) and install it.
Define the database models for the application, including the User, Post, and Comment models.
Use the ORM to create the necessary tables in the database.
Test the database connection by creating some sample data using the ORM.
Step 3: Building the Web Application

Choose a web framework (such as Flask or Django) and install it.
Create the necessary routes and views for the application, including the registration, login, post creation, and comment creation views.
Use HTML templates to render the views and display the data.
Implement form validation and error handling to ensure that the data entered by the user is valid.
Step 4: Deploying the Application to a Production Environment with Docker

Create a new Docker Compose file for the production environment, with additional services such as load balancing and caching.
Build and run the Docker containers in the production environment.
Use a reverse proxy (such as NGINX or Apache) to route traffic to the web server service.
